# OnvifSim

A virtual world whose cameras are ONVIF devices. Build a low-poly landscape (terrain, trees,
houses) in the browser, put fixed and PTZ cameras into it, and every camera answers WS-Discovery,
serves RTSP and takes PTZ commands — including AbsoluteMove — like real hardware. Point ONVIF
Device Manager, an NVR or your own client at it; no cameras needed.

> **Status: early development.** Done so far: world model, software renderer, snapshots and MJPEG
> over HTTP, RTSP with RTP/JPEG, ONVIF Device + Media + Media2 and WS-Discovery. Coming next: PTZ and
> Imaging, H.264, the browser editor, Docker image and installers (MSI, winget, snap).

## Run

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project src/OnvifSim.Server -- --data ./data --port 8080
```

On first start a default world is written to `./data/world.json`.

| Endpoint | |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/world`, `PUT /api/world` | the world as JSON |
| `GET /api/cameras` | camera list |
| `GET /api/cameras/{id}/snapshot.jpg` | one rendered frame |
| `GET /api/cameras/{id}/mjpeg` | live Motion JPEG (open it in a browser) |

## RTSP

Every camera streams Motion JPEG (RTP/JPEG, RFC 2435) at `rtsp://<host>:8554/<camera id>`:

```bash
ffplay rtsp://admin:admin@localhost:8554/cam1                       # RTP over UDP
ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://admin:admin@localhost:8554/cam2   # RTP interleaved in RTSP/TCP
```

RTP goes over UDP or interleaved in the RTSP connection, whichever the client asks for. Credentials
are the camera's `users` in `world.json` (Digest or Basic; the default world has `admin`/`admin`); a
camera with no users accepts anyone. Resolution, frame rate and JPEG quality are per camera
(`video` in `world.json`, 640×360 at 10 fps by default).

ffmpeg-based players need about 20 frames to start (they measure the frame rate first): ~2 s at the
default 10 fps, ~7 s at 3 fps. VLC and GStreamer show the first frame at once.

## ONVIF

Every camera is a device of its own, on its own port: `http://<host>:8001/onvif/device_service` for
the first camera, 8002 for the second and so on (`onvifPort` in `world.json` pins one). Each answers
WS-Discovery, so ONVIF Device Manager, an NVR or `OnvifLib.Probe --discovery` lists them all.

- **Device**: device information, clock, `GetServices`/`GetCapabilities`, scopes, users, a read-only
  view of the network settings.
- **Media** (ver10) and **Media2** (ver20): one JPEG profile with its RTSP and snapshot URIs;
  `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration` changes resolution, frame rate and quality within the offered
  options and is saved to `world.json`.
- **Authentication** as on real cameras: WS-Security UsernameToken or HTTP Digest/Basic with the
  camera's `users`; `GetSystemDateAndTime`, `GetCapabilities`, `GetServices` and `GetHostname` answer
  without credentials.

XAddrs and stream URIs use the address the client connected to. WS-Discovery advertises the address
of the route towards the client, or `--advertise-host` (`ONVIFSIM_ADVERTISE_HOST`) when that is not
reachable from outside, e.g. in a container.

## Ports

| Port | |
|---|---|
| 8080/tcp | web UI and API (`--port`, `ONVIFSIM_PORT`) |
| 8001…/tcp | ONVIF, one port per camera (`--onvif-base-port`, `ONVIFSIM_ONVIF_BASE_PORT`) |
| 8554/tcp | RTSP for all cameras (`--rtsp-port`, `ONVIFSIM_RTSP_PORT`) |
| 6970-6971/udp | RTP and RTCP of every UDP session (`--rtp-port`, `ONVIFSIM_RTP_PORT`) |
| 3702/udp | WS-Discovery (`--discovery-port`, `ONVIFSIM_DISCOVERY_PORT`; 0 turns it off) |

`--bench` prints render and JPEG timings per camera and resolution.

## How it works

One .NET 10 process, no native dependencies: the world is rendered by a built-in CPU rasterizer
(a 640×360 frame takes about 5 ms), encoded to JPEG in-process, and a camera only renders while
someone is watching it.
